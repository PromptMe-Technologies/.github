## Hi there, Welcome to the Code Vault of your Prompt Buddy, "Prompt Me" 👋


### Abstract

PromptMe is an innovative AI prompt generator Chrome extension tool that leverages the power of GPT-3.5 Turbo, the advanced language model developed by OpenAI, and the Solana blockchain to create a decentralized and incentive-driven platform. This whitepaper provides an in-depth overview of PromptMe, its architecture, and the ways it encourages users to generate prompts while participating in the Solana ecosystem.

### Introduction
PromptMe is a novel AI tool designed to harness the capabilities of GPT-3.5 Turbo, a cutting-edge language model, and the Solana blockchain to enable users to generate prompts and receive incentives for their contributions. This platform aims to promote the generation of high-quality prompts while fostering a decentralized community of users.

### Motivation
PromptMe is built on the foundation of three main motivations:

Utilizing GPT-3.5 Turbo: GPT-3.5 Turbo is a state-of-the-art language model that can generate a wide range of content. By utilizing its capabilities, PromptMe empowers users to create prompts for various applications such as content generation, creative writing, and problem-solving.
Decentralization: PromptMe leverages the Solana blockchain to provide a transparent and decentralized environment. This ensures that prompts are stored securely and transparently on the blockchain, fostering trust among users.
Incentivizing User Participation: To encourage users to contribute to the platform, PromptMe incorporates a rewards system that utilizes a native utility token, PMT. Users receive PMT tokens for generating prompts, participating in the community, and validating the quality of prompts.

### Architecture

PromptMe's architecture is composed of several key components:

GPT-3.5 Turbo Integration: The heart of PromptMe, GPT-3.5 Turbo, is responsible for generating responses to prompts. Users interact with the model through the user interface, submitting prompts for generation.

Solana Blockchain: The Solana blockchain will be used to store prompts, transaction data, and user interactions. It ensures data integrity and decentralization. Right now we are not storing User data and prompts at all.

User Interface: The user interface allows users to interact with the platform. Users can submit prompts, review generated content, and participate in the community.

Incentive Mechanism: PMT tokens are used to incentivize users. These tokens can be earned by submitting prompts, participating in platform governance, and assessing the quality of prompts.

### Platform Workflow

The workflow of PromptMe is as follows:

- User Prompt Submission: Users submit prompts via the user interface.

- GPT-3.5 Turbo Processing: The submitted prompts are processed by GPT-3.5 Turbo, which generates responses.

- Solana Blockchain Storage: The prompts, generated content, and transaction data are securely stored on the Solana blockchain later in development.

- Quality Assessment: Users participate in quality assessment by reviewing and rating prompts.

- Incentives Distribution: Users who contribute to the platform are rewarded with PMT tokens. This encourages continued participation and high-quality prompts.

### Tokenomics

- PMT tokens are at the core of PromptMe's incentive system. These tokens have several use cases, including:

- Rewarding Users: Users earn PMT tokens for generating prompts, rating prompt quality, and participating in platform governance.

- Governance: PMT token holders have the ability to participate in platform governance, influencing platform decisions.

- Staking: Users can stake PMT tokens to earn additional rewards and secure the network.


### In-App Purchases

The Trial version with 15 prompts is available for free and after that users need to subscribe to the Fully Unlocked Paid Version with unlimited generations capability available for either $50 for lifetime access or $5 per month, which can reduced to $1.99 per month by using a special coupon code as a early adopter. These prices are subject to change later and are not fixed in any way. 

### Conclusion

PromptMe is an AI prompt generator Chrome extension that combines the powerful GPT-3.5 Turbo language model with the transparency and decentralization of the Solana blockchain. This platform incentivizes users to generate prompts, participate in the community, and contribute to the quality of prompts while being rewarded with PMT tokens. PromptMe holds the potential to become a valuable resource for content generation, creative writing, and problem-solving in a decentralized and collaborative environment.
